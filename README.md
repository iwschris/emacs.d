Inspired to begin this journey by visiting [emacs.sexy](http://emacs.sexy). Taking some ideas from [magnars emacs.d](https://github.com/magnars/.emacs.d).

One drink of Kool-aid at a time...

Install & Setup
---------------

I run Emacs primarily on my Mac - and I run off of Emacs HEAD. To install the latest and greatest EMAX on Mac OS X:

```bash
$> brew install emacs --cocoa --HEAD --with-gnutls --use-git-head --srgb
```

All associated packages should install on boot (you might want to close & reopen if things seem wonky after first run).
